CXXFLAGS = -I$(INCLUDE_DIR) -O3# -I specifies the include directory as $(INCLUDE_DIR). The -O3 flag is used to optimize the code.
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIB) -lprojectV-utils -lprojectV-graphics -lprojectV-core -lGLEW -lglfw -lGL# -L specifies the library directory as $(LIB). The -l flags are used to link the libraries.
